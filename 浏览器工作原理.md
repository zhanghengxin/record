## 简介
### 1、要讨论的浏览器
| 渲染引擎(是否开源) | 浏览器 | JS解释器 |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- |
|Trident   |Internet Explorer |          |
|Gecko(是) |Firefox |                    |
|Webkit(是)|Safari、Chrome |             |
|Blink(是) |Chrome ( >28版本)、Opera(>15版本) |
|Presto(废)|Opera(旧) |                  |

根据 [W3C browser statistics](http://gs.statcounter.com/)
· 要我说--
第一第二合计72%,第三名UC，用的是Chromium(Blink).
完全可以用减法, 100% - IE% = 开源%

### 2、浏览器的主要功能
        The browser main functionality is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it on the browser window. The resource format is usually HTML but also PDF, image and more. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform resource Identifier). More on that in the network chapter.
        
        The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standards organization for the web. 
        The current version of HTML is 4 (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/). Version 5 is in progress. The current CSS version is 2 (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) and version 3 is in progress. 
        For years browsers conformed to only a part of the specifications and developed their own extensions. That caused serious compatibility issues for web authors. Today most of the browsers more or less conform to the specifications.
        
        Browsers' user interface have a lot in common with each other. Among the common user interface elements are:
        
        Address bar for inserting the URI
        Back and forward buttons
        Bookmarking options
        A refresh and stop buttons for refreshing and stopping the loading of current documents
        Home button that gets you to your home page
        Strangely enough, the browser's user interface is not specified in any formal specification, it is just good practices shaped over years of experience and by browsers imitating each other. The HTML5 specification doesn't define UI elements a browser must have, but lists some common elements. Among those are the address bar, status bar and tool bar. There are, of course, features unique to a specific browser like Firefox downloads manager. 
        More on that in the user interface chapter.

### 3、浏览器高等级结构（high level structure）
浏览器组要组成如图
![浏览器主要组成](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/layers.png)

        The user interface - this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu etc. Every part of the browser display except the main window where you see the requested page.
        The browser engine - the interface for querying and manipulating the rendering engine.
        The rendering engine - responsible for displaying the requested content. For example if the requested content is HTML, it is responsible for parsing the HTML and CSS and displaying the parsed content on the screen.
        Networking - used for network calls, like HTTP requests. It has platform independent interface and underneath implementations for each platform.
        UI backend - used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. It exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses the operating system user interface methods.
        JavaScript interpreter. Used to parse and execute the JavaScript code.
        Data storage. This is a persistence layer. The browser needs to save all sorts of data on the hard disk, for examples, cookies. The new HTML specification (HTML5) defines 'web database' which is a complete (although light) database in the browser.
## 组件通信
        Communication between the components
        组件之间的通讯
        Both Firefox and Chrome developed a special communication infrastructures. 
        火狐和谷歌研发了一个特殊的通讯设施
        They will be discussed in a special chapter.
        将在一个专用的章节讨论
### 1、呈现引擎(渲染引擎、the rendering engine)
        The responsibility of the rendering engine is well... Rendering, that is display of the requested contents on the browser screen.
        
        主要职责是在浏览器上显示请求的内容
        
        By default the rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents and images. It can display other types through a plug-in (a browser extension). An example is displaying PDF using a PDF viewer plug-in. We will talk about plug-ins and extensions in a special chapter. In this chapter we will focus on the main use case - displaying HTML and images that are formatted using CSS.
        
        默认显示HTML、XML文档和图片，可以通过插件显示其他的‘类型’,,,我们将会在专门的章节介绍插件和拓展。,,,这章节我们关注使用情况——被css格式化后显示的HTML和images

#### Rendering engines
        Our reference browsers - Firefox, Chrome and Safari are built upon two rendering engines. Firefox uses Gecko - a "home made" Mozilla rendering engine. Both Safari and Chrome use Webkit.
        
        Webkit is an open source rendering engine which started as an engine for the Linux platform and was modified by Apple to support Mac and Windows. See http://webkit.org/ for more details.
        
        Webkit 是一个开源呈现引擎,开始的用于Linux平台,后来被Apple用在Mac、Windows
        
#### The main flow
        The rendering engine will start getting the contents of the requested document from the networking layer. This will usually be done in 8K chunks.
        
        After that this is the basic flow of the rendering engine:

![rendering flow](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/flow.png)

```flow
1=>operation: 转化HTML为结构化的DOM 树
2=>operation: 转化为树结构体
3=>operation: 给渲染树排版
4=>operation: 绘制渲染树

1->2->3->4
```
